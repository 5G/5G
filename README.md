# James Gallagher (@5G)
### Senior Software Engineer • Distributed Systems • Cloud & AI

I design and build large-scale cloud systems with a focus on simplicity, resilience, and long-term maintainability. My work spans distributed architectures, serverless patterns, and the practical application of AI in engineering workflows.

I’m interested in:
- high-integrity system design  
- event-driven cloud architectures  
- developer experience and automation  
- practical AI tools in real engineering contexts  
- security-by-default in distributed systems  

I care about clear design, strong interfaces, and systems that behave predictably under load.

## 🔐 Security Contributions
I’m not a security engineer by title, but I have a habit of stumbling into meaningful security issues during my own engineering projects.
When that happens, I follow strict responsible-disclosure practices.

**Irish Government — gov.ie PDF Proxy Vulnerability (2024)**  
Identified and disclosed an issue that allowed malicious PDFs to be served through a trusted government domain.  
Resolved in coordination with CSIRT-IE.

**Ongoing Security Disclosure (2025)**  
Currently coordinating a critical cloud/API vulnerability with the US CISA Industrial Control Systems team.  
A formal CVE advisory is in progress and will be added here once published.
