# James Gallagher (@5G)
### Senior Software Engineer • Distributed Systems • Cloud & AI

I design and build large-scale cloud systems with a focus on simplicity, resilience, and long-term maintainability. My work spans distributed architectures, serverless patterns, and the practical application of AI in engineering workflows.

I’m interested in:
- high-integrity system design  
- event-driven cloud architectures  
- developer experience and automation  
- practical AI tools in real engineering contexts  
- security-by-default in distributed systems  

I care about clear design, strong interfaces, and systems that behave predictably under load.

## 🔐 Security Contributions
I’m not a security engineer by title, but I have a habit of stumbling into meaningful security issues during my own engineering projects.
When that happens, I follow strict responsible-disclosure practices.

**[CVE-2025-13932](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-13932) — Infrastructure Control System Vulnerability (2025)**  
* Discovered and reported a high-impact cloud/API access-control vulnerability affecting an energy-adjacent industrial control system. 
* Coordinated with CERT/CC and the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) ICS team. 
* Published as [ICSA-25-338-06](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/ics-advisories/icsa-25-338-06).

**Irish Government — gov.ie PDF Proxy Vulnerability (2024)**
